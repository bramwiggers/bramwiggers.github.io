							<h2>What is the Bystander Effect?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
						The Bystander Effect is a situation in which a majority individuals privately disagree with a given norm, but go along with it because they incorrectly believe that the majority agrees. In this project we used Dynamic Epistemic Logic (explained <a href="paper.html">here</a>) to implement a Multi Agent System (can be downloaded <a href="application.html">here</a>) where a bystander effect situation is modelled. The example we will use mainly is that of a corporate boardroom. When strategy is failing, it often happens that board members privately disagree with the current strategy, but go along as they believe that the majority agrees with the norm. Several other examples will be discussed <a href="#examples">below</a>, but first we exaplain how we can arrive at such a situation.
						</p> 
						<ol>
							<li><b>Notice the event.</b> When strategy is failing, it is not always easy to recognize this. When the agent does not recognize the event happening, it can't react to it.</li>
							<li><b>Interpret the event.</b> The agent has to determine if help is needed. A near bankruptcy is very clear, but most events are more epistemically ambiguous. A decrease in sales may be just a random fluctuation, or the start of the end of a company.</li>
							<li><b>Determine action.</b> The agent needs to decide whether to take an action. This seems clear, but in groups diffusion of responsibility may arise. In the board room this can be caused by uncertainty of qualities of others or unclear division of tasks.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Pluralistic Ignorance occurs in the second step. When interpreting the situation, it is possible the agent starts looking for <i>Social Proof</i>. This means the agent tries to make conclusions from the actions of other agents. We can see what happens in the picture below. </p>

						<p>Flowchart of the dynamics leading to the bystander effect. Boxes with solid
							lines represent epistemic states – boxes with dotted lines indicate events. We can see how agents initially are in a situation where they believe someting is wrong. However, after they misinterpret the actions of others, they use social proof to reevaluate their beliefs. After they have reevaluated their beliefs, all of them go to a state where they do not intervene, because others did not. The flowchart is discussed for the board room case below. From: <i>R. K. Rendsvig, “Pluralistic ignorance in the bystander effect: Informational dynamics of unresponsivewitnesses in situations calling for intervention,”Synthese, vol. 191, no. 11, pp. 2471–2498, 2014.</i></p>

						<h3>An Epistemic timeline of the Bystander Effect</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Nothing has happened.</b> The firm is doing fine and no strategy change is needed.</li>
							<li><b>Epistemically ambiguous event.</b> Something happens and it's not clear whether action is needed. This might be a drop in sales for the firm, but not sure for agents whether a strategy change is needed.</li>
							<li><b>All believe there is a problem, no-one has information about others' beliefs.</b> The agents think the firm is doing badly and strategy change is needed. They do not know what their colleagues think.</li>
							<li><b>Choose Action: Intervene Observe or Evade?</b> The agents need to decide whether they want to change the strategy, observe what happens or keep the current strategy.</li>
							<li><b>All believe that only they observed, others are believed to have evaded.</b> The agents see that their colleagues are not intervening, so they assume they want to keep the strategy intact. They also think they are the only one who observe the others.</li>
							<li><b>Interpretation of action: What beliefs could others hold that would make them evade?</b> The agents start to think about why the others want to keep the current strategy.</li>
							<li><b>All believe there is a problem and everyone else believes there is none.</b> The agents think that they are the only one who think the firm is performing poorly.</li>
							<li><b>Revise beliefs in light of social proof.</b> The agent use social proof to think about their opinion. "If I'm the only one who thinks the firm is doing bad, maybe it's not so bad after all."</li>
							<li><b>All believe there is no problem.</b> The agents do no longer believe the strategy is bad.</li>
							<li><b>Choose again: intervene, observe, evade?</b> The agents choose their action again.</li>
							<li><b>Everybody evades.</b> All agents think that there is no problem because they think everyone thinks this.</li>

									<h3>Public Crime</h3>
								</header>
								<p>One well known example of the Bystander Effect happens in public.  In this case, a crime is happeningon the street and a crowd is able to see the crime and intervene.  However, the crowd can see thecrowd as well, and because people see how others do not react, they are themselves reluctant toreact as well [2].</p>

									<h3>Climate Change</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Another example is climate change.  In this case, it is also true that everyone isresponsible and everyone knows that everyone is responsible.  Next to this, everyone can see that others are not reacting, and therefore can assume that others are accepting the norm of polluting [5].</p>

									<h3>Alcohol Consumption</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The bystander effect is also found in alcohol consumption on campus.  Many students assume they are more uncomfortable with alcohol practices than the average student.  Students even felt alienated from the campus, although this perceived deviance to peers was illusionary [6].</p>

									<h3>Strategy decisions</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The problem occurs as well in board rooms.  When a certain direction is not feasible anymore, companies often continue in the same path whereas they privately know this is not the right direction.  One explanation  for  this  is  pluralistic  ignorance [8].</p>

									<h3>Abilene Paradox</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Jerry B. Harvey was enjoying a hot afternoon with his family in Coleman, Texas, when his father in-law suggests to have dinner in Abilene, 85 km away. Everyone agrees and Jerry, not wanting to spoil the fun, agrees as well. The drive is hot and long, and the food even worse. When the group returns, one of them sarcastically states how 'wonderful' the trip was. At this moment everyone agrees that they did not want to go. The group is perplexed. Everyone agreed to go on a trip which no one wanted to join.[3] </p>

									<h3>Racial Segregation</h3>
								</header>
								<p> One problem which had a big impact on the history of the United States is the segregation of whites and blacks. O’Gorman [7] found that many whites overestimated the support of other whites for racial segregation, but themselves being not in favor. Data shows that in East North Central America the amount of people in favor was 14% whereas the same people believed that 48% of the other people was in favor of segregation.</p>

					<h2>Friendship ties</h2>
					<p>Westphal et. al. ([8]) proposes dense friendship ties to moderate the effect of pluralistic ignorance as it increases the propensity for directors to speak up.  One of the reasons for pluralistic ignorance given by Westphal et. al. is the loss of face when speaking up against the norm.  Because friends will not condemn you for a different opinion the possibility to speak up is bigger. Another reason for pluralistic ignorance is the inability to judge the average belief of a group. Because friends see each other more often in informal settings, it is possible to speak more freely and discuss private concerns.  When people are able to discuss their own concerns, they might discover that  others  share  their  opinion  and  discuss  their  concerns  with  the  whole group </p>
