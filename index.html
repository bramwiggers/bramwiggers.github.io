						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>We will use Dynamic Epistemic Logic to clarify pluralistic ignorance and see how we can break problems like the bystander effect.  Our research question is therefore:  ”Is it possible to break the problem of pluralistic ignorance by theuse of Dynamic Epistemic Logic?” Several papers have already touched upon this problem, with varying results [5, 6, 7].</p>

						<h2>Pluralistic Ignorance as a real problem</h2>
						<p>In this research, we will focus on pluralistic ignorance in Multi-Agent Systems. Pluralistic ignorance occurs when agents privately reject a certain norm, but incorrectly assume that others accept it.</p>

									<h3>The Bystander Effect</h3>
								</header>
								<p>One well known example is the ’Bystander Effect’.  In this case, a crime is happeningon the street and a crowd is able to see the crime and intervene.  However, the crowd can see thecrowd as well, and because people see how others do not react, they are themselves reluctant toreact as well [1].</p>

									<h3>Climate Change</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Another example is climate change.  In this case, it is also true that everyone isresponsible and everyone knows that everyone is responsible.  Next to this, everyone can see thatothers are not reacting, and therefore can assume that others are accepting the norm of polluting [2].</p>

									<h3>Alcohol Consumption</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Pluralistic ignorance is also found in alcohol consumption on campus.  Many students assumethey are more uncomfortable with alcohol practices than the average student.  Students even feltalienated from the campus, although this perceived deviance to peers was illusionary [3].</p>

									<h3>Strategy decisions</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The problem occurs as well in board rooms.  When a certain direction is not feasible anymore, companiesoften continue in the same path whereas they privately know this is not the right direction.  Oneexplanation  for  this  is  pluralistic  ignorance [4].</p>

					<h2>Further Steps</h2>
					<p>In further steps we see a lot of possibility to test moderation in pluralistic ignorance.  As suggested by [4], dense friendship ties and demographic homogeneity can moderate the effect of pluralistic ignorance as it increases the propensity for directots to speak up.  A formal definition of friendship ties and homogeneous demography can be given and the results can be found in the model, as this relates to real world data.</p>
